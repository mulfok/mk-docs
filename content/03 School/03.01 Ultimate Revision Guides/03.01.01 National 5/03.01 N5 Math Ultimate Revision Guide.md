### Surds
A surd is a number which does not give an integer for square or cubic roots.
#### Simplifying
You should always look for a square num ber when simplifying.

> Square numbers include: *4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144...*

_Examples:_

$$\sqrt28 = \sqrt4 \times \sqrt7$$
$$= 2\sqrt7$$

In terms of making life easier for yourself, always look for the **greatest square number** you can use.

$$\sqrt200 = \sqrt100 \times \sqrt2$$
$$= 10\sqrt2$$

Is a *lot* simpler than:

$$\sqrt200 = \sqrt4 \times \sqrt50$$
$$= 2\sqrt50$$
$$= 2 \times \sqrt25 \times \sqrt2$$
$$= 2 \times 5 \times \sqrt2$$
$$= 10\sqrt2$$

#### Adding/Subtracting
Only possible if the values of the root brackets are the **same.**

_Examples:_

1. $$6\sqrt6 + 2\sqrt6 = 8\sqrt6$$
2. $$5\sqrt3 - 2\sqrt3 + 3\sqrt3 = 6\sqrt3$$

> $$2\sqrt3 + 3\sqrt5$$
> Cannot be added as the root brackets are not the same.

If presented with an add/subtracting question that looks like this:

$$\sqrt72 - \sqrt50$$

...simplify the surds and then work from there!

$$\sqrt72 - \sqrt50$$
$$= \sqrt36 \times \sqrt2 - \sqrt25 \times \sqrt2$$
$$= 6\sqrt2 - 5\sqrt2$$
$$= \sqrt2$$

#### Multiplying
You can always multiply *fully simplified* surds together.

> $$\sqrt a \times \sqrt a = a$$
> This is a useful rule to remember that stops you from having to write extra lines.

_Examples:_

1. $$\sqrt3 \times \sqrt7 = \sqrt21$$

**Always simplify if possible.**

2. $$\sqrt6 \times \sqrt2 = \sqrt12$$
	$$= \sqrt4 \times \sqrt3$$
	$$= 2\sqrt3$$

You can also break equations down.

3. $$3\sqrt2 \times 4\sqrt5$$
	$$= 3 \times \sqrt2 \times 4 \times \sqrt5$$
	$$= 12\sqrt10$$

#### Dividing
Lorem ipsum

#### Rationalising Denominators
Fractions that contain surds are easier to deal with if the denominators are not surds.

> $$\sqrt a \times \sqrt a = a$$
> Remember this? This will come into play a lot!

_Examples:_

1. $$\frac{2}{\sqrt6} \times \sqrt6 = \frac{2\sqrt6}{6} = \frac{\sqrt6}{3}$$
2. $$\frac{7}{2\sqrt3} \times \sqrt3 = \frac{7\sqrt3}{6}$$


### Multiplying Brackets
There are two methods to multiplying brackets out. *F.O.I.L.* and *rainbow.* Using both is essential to solving these equations.

#### Single Brackets
1. $$5(3x \times 2) = 15x + 10$$
2. $$20(4y - 1) = 80y - 20$$
3. $$3(4 - 6x) = 12 - 18x$$
4. $$2x(x - 10) = 2x^2 - 20x$$

As you can see, single brackets are easy to manage. Most of it is simple multiplication, so there is little need to worry.

#### Double Brackets
1. $$(2x - 10)(4 - 3x)$$
	$$= 8x - 6x^2 - 40 + 30x$$
	$$= 38x - 6x^2 - 40$$

2. $$(3x + 4)(x - 2)$$
	$$= 3x^2 - 6x + 4x - 8$$

Watch out for double negatives!

3. $$(6y - 4)(2y - 3)$$
	$$12y^2 - 18y - 8y + 12$$
	$$12y^2 - 26y + 12$$

Double brackets are a little more difficult and require the *F.O.I.L.* method of working.

#### Double Brackets With > 2 Terms
If a double brackets question has > 2 terms, it will be necessary to use the rainbow method of working. Do questions like these *SLOWLY.*

1. $$(x + 4)(x^2 + 3x - 2)$$
	$$= x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x + 4x^2 + 12x - 8$$
	$$= x^3 + 7x^2 + 10x - 8$$

2. $$(x + 3)(x^2 + x + 5)$$
	$$= x^3 + x^2 + 5x + 3x^2 + 3x + 15$$
	$$= x^3 + 4x^2 + 8x + 15$$

#### Triple Brackets
Triple brackets are actually double brackets in disguise. You just need to multiply two brackets out into a single one.

1. $$(x + 5)(x - 10)(x + 2)$$
	$$= (x^2 − 10x + 5x − 50)(x + 2)$$
	$$= (x^2 − 5x − 50)(x + 2)$$
	$$= x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x^2 - 10x - 50x - 100$$
	$$= x^3 - 3x^2 - 60x - 100$$

2. $$(x - 2)(x + 3)(x + 5)$$
	$$= (x - 2)(x^2 + 5x + 3x + 15)$$
	$$= (x - 2)(x^2 + 8x + 15)$$
	$$= x^3 + 8x^2 + 15x - 2x^2 - 16x - 30$$
	$$= x^3 + 6x^2 - x - 30$$

### Indices
There are certain rules to follow when working with indices.

#### Multiplying Indices
1. $$y^2 \times y^5 = y^{2+5} = y^7$$
2. $$3^7 \times 3^{12} = 3^{7+12} = 3^{19}$$
3. $$2a^3 \times 4a^7 = 8a^{3+7} = 8^{10}$$

> In general for multiplying: $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$

#### Dividing Indices
1. $$\frac{x^5}{x^3} = x^{5-3} = x^2$$
2. $$\frac{21a^6}{3a^2} = 7a^{6-2} = 7a^4$$
3. $$\frac{n^5}{n^7} = n^{5-7} = n^{-2}$$

> In general for dividing: $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$

#### Indices In Brackets
1. $$(x^5)^3 = x^5 \times x^5 \times x^5 = x^{15}$$
2. $$(2^2)^7 = 2^{14}$$
3. $$(a^2b)^4 = a^8b^4$$
4. $$(2q^2)^3 = 2^3q^6 = 8q^6$$

> In general for indices in brackets: $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$

#### Zero Powers
Zero powers are really easy to wrap your head around. Quite literally: $a^0 = 1$.

#### Fractional Indices
We can turn a [surd](#surds)-like expression into an index power using the general rule:
> $$\sqrt[n]a = a^\frac{1}{n}$$

_Examples:_

1. $$x^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{x}$$
2. $$p^\frac{1}{4} = \sqrt[4]p$$
3. $$8^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]8$$
4. $$125^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]125 = 5$$
5. $$4^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4^\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt4} = \frac{1}{2}$$

> There's also a way to make finding the roots of big numbers easier. Instead of:
> 
> $$125^\frac{2}{3} = \sqrt[3]125^2$$
> $$= \sqrt[3]15625$$
> $$= 25$$
> 
> Do:
> $$125^\frac{2}{3} = (\sqrt[3]125)^2$$
> $$= 5^2$$
> $$= 25$$
> 
> You'll save time, and won't shoot yourself trying to figure out roots of huge numbers.

### Significant Figures
The basic rules for rounding are the same as for decimal places, however significant figures give us a sense of 'Quantity and Accuracy'.

Zeroes **may or may not** be significant depending on the **position of the zero.**

_Amount of s.f. in a number:_
1. $$52800 \longrightarrow 3\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$
2. $$109200 \longrightarrow 4\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$
3. $$6.20 \longrightarrow 2\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$
4. $$0.085 \longrightarrow 2\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$
5. $$0.0403 \longrightarrow 3\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$
6. $$0.00720 \longrightarrow 3\hspace{1mm}s.f.$$

_Rounding to a s.f:_

1. $$7249 \hspace{2.5mm} 2\hspace{1mm}s.f. \longrightarrow 7200$$
2. $$0.147 \hspace{2.5mm} 2\hspace{1mm}s.f \longrightarrow 0.15$$
3. $$0.006594 \hspace{2.5mm} 2\hspace{1mm}s.f. \longrightarrow 0.0066$$

...Simple!

> Hey! Only worry about the value of the number **behind the significant figure.**
> $$7249 = 7200 \hspace{2mm} NOT \hspace{2mm} 7249 = 7300$$

### Factorising
This is the reverse of multiplying brackets. These are three types of factorising:
- Common Factors
- Difference of Two Squares
- Trinomials

#### Common Factors
For factorising with common factors, do just that.

1. $$3x + 6 = 3(x + 2)$$
2. $$15 + 20p = 5(3 + 4p)$$
3. $$8y - 12y^2 = 4y(2 - 3y)$$

#### Difference of Two Squares
Spotting a difference of two squares question is dead simple. If asked to factorise and the equation looks like $a^2 - b^2$, then it's a difference of two squares.

> $$a^2 - b^2 = (\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})$$
> How to factor down.

_Examples:_

1. $$m^2 - 4 = (m + 2)(m - 2)$$
2. $$x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$$
3. $$16c^2 - 25 = (4c + 5)(4c - 5)$$
4. $$9k^2 - 1 = (3k + 1)(3k - 1)$$

Sometimes you'll run into a question which doesn't have a square number for one of the terms, chances are you can factor that term with a common factor.

5. $$2x^2 - 18$$
	$$= 2(x^2 - 9)$$
	$$= 2(x + 3)(x - 3)$$

6. $$10a^2 - 90b^2$$
	$$= 10(a^2 - 9b^2)$$
	$$= 10(a + 3b)(a - 3b)$$

#### Trinomials
There can also be factorised down into two double brackets.
The general form of a trinomial is as follows: $ax^2 + bx + c$

$$x^2 + 8x + 15$$
$$= (x + 3)(x + 5)$$

In the above example, we look for a pair of numbers that **multiply to 15, and add to 8.** In this case, that pair is 3 and 5 - which then get slotted into the brackets. And that is how you'll solve most of these kinds of questions.

Here's another example, but with negatives:

$$y^2 - 9y + 14$$
$$= (y - 2)(y - 7)$$

An easy way of finding the pair of numbers to go into the brackets is by drawing a small table and just testing a bunch of sensible-looking numbers. Let's use this as an example:

$$d^2 + 3d - 10$$

...And let's make a table to test some possible number pairs.

x  | 1 |-1 | 2 |-2
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
x  |-10| 10|-5 | 5 

In here, we find that the number pair -2 and 5 **multiply to -10, and add to 3.** So all that's left is to slot the numbers in.

$$d^2 + 3d - 10$$
$$=(x - 2)(x + 5)$$

### Arcs and Sectors
For arcs and sectors, you need to be familiar with the two N4 formulae for circles:

> $C = \pi D \longrightarrow$ Circumference
> $A = \pi r^2 \longrightarrow$ Area

#### Arcs
##### Non-Calculator Arc Questions
In Paper 01 in an exam, you will not have access to a calculator for these questions. This can make things very difficult, especially if you are not good at doing calculations in you head.

Thankfully, the SQA at least makes the numbers _somewhat_ easy to compute. Let’s look at an example.

%%![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/7b9adf190c260c4cb3bf03b87c77edce]]%%

```ad-question
The diagram below shows a sector of a circle, centre C.

![[dea37a623e03cb0e8021685fb909a965.png|200]]

The radius of the circle is 30 centimetres.
Calculate the length of the malor arc AB.
**Take** $\pi=3.14$. **(3 MARKS)**
```

Let’s start by plugging in all the right numbers.

$$C = \pi D$$
$$AB = \frac{240}{360} \times 3.14 \times 60$$
$$AB = \frac{2}{3} \times 3.14 \times 60$$

So, now that we have everything there, we need to start by getting rid of terms.

$$AB = 3.14 \times 40$$

Now we have this simple looking thing. So now, we need to add $3\times40$ and $0.14\times40$.

![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/e0dc7e7b78cc09c52c63e067f79d131d.png|300]]
%%![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/9a23b4ac4ac32a075c551b373ee1b3ec]]%%

Then put it into your answer…

$$AB = \frac{2}{3} \times 3.14 \times 60$$
$$AB = 3.14 \times 40$$
$$AB = 125.6cm$$

It’s a lot of work, but that’s how to answer these questions!

### Trigonometry

#### Trigonometric Graphs
##### Sine
The sine wave a is a wave that looks like this:

```chart
type: line
labels: [0,90,180,270,360]
series:
  - title: y = sin x
    data: [0,1,0,-1,0]
tension: 0.34
width: 80%
labelColors: true
fill: true
beginAtZero: false
```

The formula for a sine wave is:
> $$y = a \sin{bx} + c$$
> where:
> $a$ is the amplitude of the wave
> $b$ is the period of the wave
> $c$ is the vertical translation of the wave

##### Cosine
The cosine wave is a wave that looks like:

```chart
type: line
labels: [0,90,180,270,360]
series:
  - title: y = cos x
    data: [1,0,-1,0,1]
tension: 0.34
width: 80%
labelColors: true
fill: true
beginAtZero: false
```

The cosine wave is very similar to a [sine wave](#sine) except that it starts at **1** instead of **0**,

The formula for a cosine wave is:
> $$y = a\cos{bx}+c$$
> $a$ is the amplitude of the wave
> $b$ is the period of the wave
> $c$ is the vertical translation of the wave

##### Tan

#### The Straight Line

#### Area of a Triangle
> Diagram of SOHCAHTOA

You should be familiar with this from National 4.

Normally, we are familiar with trigonometry and right-angled triangles, however there are formula _(which are in the SQA Formula List)_ for other triangles.

The formula for the area of a triangle is:
> $$Area = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}$$
> <p align=center>or</p>
> 
> $$Area = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin{A}$$
> <p align=center>or</p>
> 
> $$Area = \frac{1}{2}ac\sin{B}$$

_Examples:_
1. $Area = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin{A}$
	$\hspace12mm = \frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 8 \times \sin{50}$
	$\hspace12mm = 33.7cm^2$

#### Finding An Angle of A Triangle Using The Sine Rule

### Functions
This usually involves substituting a number or letter into an expression. If you take Computing or have a history in it, you may find that this is very similar to how functions work in there.

**Functions look like:**
$$f(x)$$

_Examples:_
1. Solve $f(x) = 3x - 2$ where:
	1. $x = 4$
	> $f(4) = 3 \times 4 - 2$
	> $\hspace10.5mm = 10$
	
	2. $x = -5$
	> $f(-5) = 3 \times -5 - 2$
	> $\hspace14.5mm = -17$

	3. $x = \frac{1}{2}$
	> $f(\frac{1}{2}) = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} - 2$
	> $\hspace11.75mm = -\frac{1}{2}$ 

2. Solve $g(x) = x^2 + 7x$ where:
	1. $x = 3$
	> $g(3) = 3^2 + 7 \times 3$
	> $\hspace10.05mm = 9 + 21$
	> $\hspace10.05mm = 30$

	2. $x = -2$
	> $g(-2) = (-2)^2 + 7 \times -2$
	> $\hspace13.5mm = 4 + (-14)$
	> $\hspace13.5mm = -10$

Occasionally you'll be asked to find the original value from a given equation. For example:

Given $h(x) = 3x - 7$, calculate $a$ for $h(a) = 8$.
> $h(a) = 3a - 7 = 8$
> $\hspace24mm 3a = 15$
> $\hspace26.5mm a = 5$

### Equations

#### Balancing
We can use the "balancing" method of working to eliminate terms from one or both sides of an equation.

_Examples:_

1. $$x - 7 = 8$$
	$$x = 15$$

2. $$3y = 21$$
	$$y = \frac{21}{3}$$
	$$y = 7$$

3. $$\frac{a}{4} = 6$$
	$$4 \times \frac{a}{4} = 6 \times 4$$
	$$a = 24$$

4. $$4x + 2 = 18$$
	$$4x = 16$$
	$$x = 4$$
	
5. $$17 = 2 - 3a$$
	$$15 = 2 - 3a$$
	$$15 = - 3a$$
	$$a = -5$$
	
6. $$7x - 9 = 3x + 15$$
	$$4x - 9 = 15$$
	$$4x = 24$$
	$$x = 6$$
	
7. $$2(y + 4) = 14$$
	$$2y + 8 = 14$$
	$$2y = 6$$
	$$y = 3$$
	
8. $$5 - 3(p - 2) = 5$$
	$$5 - 3p + 6 = 5$$
	$$11 - 3p = 5$$
	$$-3p = -6$$
	$$p = 2$$

#### Equations With Fractions
If we can eliminate any fraction terms, the usual balancing steps can be performed.

> $$\frac{x}{5} = 6$$ is the same as $$\frac{1}{5}x = 6$$

_Examples:_

1. $$\frac{x}{5} = 6 \longrightarrow \frac{1}{5}x = 6$$
	$$5 \times \frac{1}{5}x = 6 \times 5$$
	$$x = 30$$

2. $$\frac{3}{4}(2x - 1) = 9$$
	$$4 \times \frac{3}{4}(2x - 1) = 9 \times 4$$
	$$3(2x - 1) = 36$$
	$$6x - 3 = 36$$
	$$6x = 39$$
	$$x = \frac{13}{2} \hspace2mm or \hspace2mm x = 6\frac{1}{2}$$

3. $$\frac{3}{4}x - 4 = \frac{2}{5}x + 2 \rightarrow \times (4 \times 5)$$
	$$\frac{60}{4}x - 80 = \frac{40}{5}x + 40$$
	$$15x - 80 = 8x + 40$$
	$$7x - 80 = 40$$
	$$7x = 120$$
	$$x = \frac{120}{7} \hspace2mm or \hspace2mm x = 17\frac{1}{7}$$

#### Inequations
Most steps with inequations are the same as solving normal equations, using the balancing method.

_Examples:_

1. $$3x + 5 \geq 29$$
	$$3x \geq 24$$
	$$x \geq 8$$
	
2. $$2x + 7 \leq 3x - 11$$
	$$7 \leq x - 11$$
	$$18 \leq x$$
	$$x \geq 18$$

The only "weird" rule to note about inequations is that when _multiplying or dividing by a **negative**, the inequality sign **swaps around.**_ For example:

3. $$-6y < 18$$
	$$ y > -3$$
	
4. $$3x < 6(x - 1) - 12$$
	$$3x < 6x - 6 - 12$$
	$$3x < 6x - 18$$
	$$-3x < -18$$
	$$x > 6$$

#### Changing The Subject of a Formula
This involves the same skills as balancing equations. it is important to know the order of the operations to find the new subject.

_Examples:_
Here we make $x$ the subject of the formula.

1. $$2x - 3 = 7$$
	$$2x = 7 + 3$$
	$$2x = 10$$
	$$x = \frac{10}{2}$$
	$$x = 5$$

2. $$ax - b = c$$
	$$ax = c + b$$
	$$x = \frac{c + b}{a}$$
	
3. $$d = st$$
	$$t = \frac{d}{s}$$

#### Simultaneous Equations
There are three main ways to solve these kinds of equations.
1. ==Graphically==
2. ==Substitution==
3. ==Elimination==

_**Elimination**_
When eliminating either $x$ or $y$ terms, we should add the equations together. Id may be necessary to multiply one or both equations first.

_Examples:_

When solving these equations, I **highly recommend** labeling your equations and annotating what you are doing. You'll be far less likely to make mistakes this way. (Here, I label my equations as $E_n$, but you do whatever)

$$x + y = 7 \longrightarrow E_1$$
$$x - y = 3 \longrightarrow E_2$$
$$E_1 + E_2$$
$$2x = 10$$
$$x = 5$$
$$Sub \hspace2mm x = 5 \hspace2mm into \hspace2mm E_1.$$
$$x + y = 7$$
$$5 + y = 7$$
$$y = 2 \longrightarrow (5,2)$$

It's quite the long winded process, but it's the most common simultaneous equations question type, and can be an easy **4-5 marks**.

Let's look at another example, but we have to *multiply* this time around.

$$4x - 3y = 5 \longrightarrow E_1$$
$$2x + 2y = 6 \longrightarrow E_2$$
$$E_2 \times -2 = E_3$$
$$-4x - 4y = -12 \longrightarrow E_3$$
$$E_1 + E_3$$
$$-7y = -7$$
$$y = 1$$
$$Sub \hspace2mm y = 1 \hspace2mm into \hspace2mm E_2$$
$$2x + 2y = 6$$
$$2x + 2 = 6$$
$$2x = 4$$
$$x = 2 \longrightarrow (2,1)$$

...And done! We had to multiply $E_2$ first to be able to eliminate $x$, but from there, it was just like any other simultaneous equations question.

Unfortunately, the SQA like making things more complicated, so we'll look at an actual exam-style question.

1. John bought 7 bags of cement and 3 bags of gravel. The total weight of these bags was 215 kilograms.
	
	1. Write down an equation to illustrate this information. (1)

		> $7c + 3g = 215$
	
	Shona bought 5 bags of cement and 4 bags of gravel.  The total weight of her bags was 200 kilograms.
	
	2. Write down an equation to illustrate this information. (1)

		> $5c + 4g = 200$

	3. Calculate the weight of one bag of cement and the weight of one bag of gravel. (4)

		> $$7c + 3g = 215 \rightarrow E_1$$
		> $$5c + 4g = 200 \rightarrow E_2$$
		> $$E_1 \times 4 \rightarrow 28c + 12g = 860 \rightarrow E_3$$
		> $$E_2 \times -3 \rightarrow -13c - 12g = -600 \rightarrow E_4$$
		> $$E_3 + E_4$$
		> $$15c = 260$$
		> $$c = 17.3 \longrightarrow Bag \hspace2mm of \hspace2mm cement = 17.3kg$$
		> $$Sub \hspace2mm c = 17.3 \hspace2mm into \hspace2mm E_2$$
		> $$5c + 4g = 200$$
		> $$86.5 + 4g = 200$$
		> $$4g = 113.5$$
		> $$g = 28.4 \longrightarrow Bag \hspace2mm of \hspace2mm gravel = 28.4kg$$

Equations with numbers as awkward as these are highly unlikely to be asked in a non-calculator paper, so there's little need to worry about being able to calculate everything.

Calculating uses the following formula. You don't need to worry about memorising the formula, as it is provided in the [SQA Formula Sheet](<#sqa formula sheet>).

$$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$$

Where $r$ = radius.

Let's use this in some practical examples.

_Examples:_
1. Find the volume of:
	1. a sphere with radius = 5cm.
		> $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
		> $\hspace5mm = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times 5^3$
		> $\hspace5mm = 523.6cm^3$
		> $\hspace5mm = 520cm^3$ (2 s.f)

	2. a hemisphere with diameter = 14m.
		> $V_S = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
		> $\hspace6.5mm = \frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times \ 7^3$
		> $\hspace6.5mm = 1436.8m^3$
		> $V_H = 1436.8 \div 2$
		> $\hspace7.25mm = 718.4m^3$

These were some pretty standard examples. But on the complex side of things, you may be asked to _find one of the other values from the volume alone._

2. If the volume of sphere is $1000cm^3$, find the radius.
	> $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
	> $1000 = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
	> $3000 = 4 \pi r^3$
	> $\frac{3000}{4\pi} = r^3$
	> $r^3 = 238.7$
	> $r = \sqrt{238.7}$
	> $r = 6.2cm$

#### Volume of a Cone
Calculating uses the following formula. Again, you can find it in the [SQA Formula Sheet](<#sqa formula sheet>).

$$V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$$
Where $r$ = radius, $h$ = height.

_Examples:_
1. Find the volume of a cone where radius = 8cm, and height = 20cm.
> $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$
> $\hspace5mm = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 8^2 \times 20$
> $\hspace5mm = 1340.412...$
> $\hspace5mm = 1340cm^3$ (3 s.f)

2. Find the volume of the cone. ![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/22f7f09ab1649aede5bdfb91e860ce0f.png|inlR|125]]
> $h = 50m$
> $r = 15m$
> $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$
> $\hspace5mm = \frac{1}{3} \pi 15^2 50$
> $\hspace5mm = 11780.972...$
> $\hspace5mm = 11800m^3$ (3 s.f) 

So these are the most basic question types for these cones. But, there are a couple harder ones. For example, you might not be given the height of the cone, but the height _of the sloped edge._ In this case, you will have to use **pythagoras.**

3. For a cone where radius = 6cm and sloping edge = 10cm, find its volume. ![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/dd6749b13cdd3c5eedfb5eb0610d01fb.png|inlR|170]]
> $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
> $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$
> $b^2 = 10^2 - 6^2$
> $b^2 = 64$
> $b = \sqrt{64}$
> $b = 8cm$
> $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$
> $\hspace5mm = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times 6^2 \times 8$
> $\hspace5mm = 301.59...$
> $\hspace5mm = 302cm^3$ (3 s.f)

#### Volume of a Pyramid
Calculating uses the following formula. This formula is also given in the [SQA Formula Sheet](<#sqa formula sheet>).

$$V = \frac{1}{3}Ah$$
Where $A$ = base area, $h$ = height.

_Examples:_
1. A pyramid has a rectangular base measuring 8cm by 7cm and a vertical height of 10cm. Calculate the volume of the pyramid

	> $V = \frac{1}{3}Ah$
	> $\hspace5mm = \frac{1}{3} \times 8 \times 7 \times 10$
	> $\hspace5mm = 186.666...$
	> $\hspace5mm = 187cm^3$ (3 s.f)

### Quadratics
#### Completing The Square
This is a technique which is necessary for the topic on quadratics.

_Examples:_
1. $$x^2 + 10x$$
	$$=(x + 5)^2 - 25$$

2. $$m^2 + 8m + 2$$
	$$= (m+4)^2 - 16 + 2$$
	$$= (m + 4^2) - 14$$

3. $$y^2 + 14y - 9$$
	$$= (y + 7)^2 - 49 - 9$$
	$$= (y + 7)^2 - 58$$
