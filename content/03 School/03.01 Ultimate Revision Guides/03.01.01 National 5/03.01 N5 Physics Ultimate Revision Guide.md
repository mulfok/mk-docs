### Waves and Radiation
#### Waves
##### Wave Parameters and Behaviours
All ==waves transfer energy== from one place to another.
There are two types of wave: ==Transverse==, and ==Longitudinal==.

###### Transverse Wave
The particles of the medium carrying the wave move (_vibrate_) at ==right angles== to the ==direction of energy travel==.

Examples of transverse waves include:
- Waver Waves
- Electromagnetic Waves (_Light_)

###### Longitudinal Wave
The particles of the medium carrying the wave move (_vibrate_) ==parallel to the direcsion of energy travel==.

Examples of longitudinal wave include:
- Sound

###### Wave Definitions
| Characteristic | Definiton                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Period         | Time taken for one wave to pass a point.                             |
| Frequency      | Number of waves passing a point each second.                         |
| Amplitude      | Distance from the mid line to a wave crest or wave trough.           | 
| Wavelength     | The distance between a point on a wave and the next identical point. |
| Wave Speed     | Distance the wave travels each second.                               |

##### Oscilloscope Screens

##### Wave Characteristic Calculations
The **frequency** of a wave can be calculated using the formula:
$$f = \frac{N}{t}$$
where:
- $f$ = frequency of the wave measured in hertz (Hz)
- $N$ = number of waves
- $t$ = time measured in seconds (s)

The **period** of a wave can be calculated using the formula:
$$T = \frac{1}{f}$$
where:
- $T$ = period of the wave measured in seconds (s)
- $f$ = frequency of the wave measured in hertz (Hz)

##### The Wave Equation
The speed of a wave can be calculated if you know its wavelength and the frequency using the formula:
$$v = f\lambda$$
where:
- $v$ = speed of the wave measured in metres per second (ms$^{-1}$)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength measured in metres (m)
- $f$ frequency measured in hertz (Hz)

##### Speed, Distance, and Time
The speed of a wave can also be calculated from the distance it travels in a given time using the formula:
$$d = vt$$
where:
- $v$ = speed of wave measured in metres per second (ms$^{-1}$)
- $d$ = distance wave travels in metres (m)
- $t$ = time taken for wave to travel given distance (s)

##### Diffraction
Waves travel in straight lines until they hit an object. When waves hit an object they bend around the object. We call this diffraction. Diffraction can occur with any type of wave.

**Wavelength** - The greater the wavelength, the greater the diffraction.
**Gap Size** - The smaller the gap, the greater the diffraction.

Radio waves will diffract around an object such as a large building or a hill. Short wave, higher frequency broadcasts, such as television waves, will be blocked by a hill. Longer broadcasts such as radio broadcasts, are able to diffract around the hill more.

##### Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum consists of a family of waves, one of which is light. All parts of the EM spectrum:
- are ==transverse waves==
- can travel through a vacuum
- travel at ==$3.0\times10^8$== in a vacuum

The higher the frequency of the waves in the spectrum, the more energy they carry. Therefore high frequency waves such as X-rays and gamma radiation are the most dangerous.

### Electricity

#### Series and Parallel Circuit Rules
Circuit | Current 	| Voltage 	| Resistance
------- | ---------	| ---------	| ---
Series	| Current is the same at any part of the circuit. $$I_S = I_1 = I_2 = \hspace2mm ...$$ ==**Same**== | Voltage across the components add to supply voltage. $$V_S = V_1 + V_2 + \hspace2mm ...$$ ==**Shared**== | $$R_t = R_1 + R_2 + \hspace2mm ...$$
Parallel| Adding current in each branch will equal the supply current $$I_S = I_1 + I_2 + \hspace2mm ...$$ ==**Shared**== | Voltage across branch equals the supply voltage. $$V_S = V_1 = V_2 = \hspace2mm ...$$ ==**Same**== | $$\frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \hspace2mm ...$$

#### Electrical Charge Carriers
Electric charge is either positive or negative. Negative charge is made up of electrons and it is electrons which flow through a conductor when a current flows.

The flow of electricity is ALWAYS *positive $\longrightarrow$ negative.*

##### Current
The current in a circuit is a measure of the rate of plow of charge through it. In other words ==current is the charge passing through a point per second.==

Current is given the symbol $I$ and is measured in Amperes (A).

Current is measured using an ammeter. Ammeters are always placed in series (in line) with a component. It doesn't matter if the ammeter is before or after the component, the current is the same.

> Current is calculated using:
> $$Q = It$$
> where:
> - $Q$ = ==charge== measured in ==coulombs== (C)
> - $I$ = ==current== measured in ==amperes== (A)
> - $t$ = ==time== measured in ==seconds== (s)

##### Ohm's Law
The resistance of an electrical circuit can be investigated using a voltmeter and an ammeter.

> Voltage, current, and resistance are related in the following formula.
> $$V = IR$$
> where:
> - $V$ = ==Voltage== (V)
> - $I$ = ==Current== (A)
> - $R$ = ==Resistance== ($\Omega$)

_Worked Examples:_
1. A ==12 V== supply is connected to a lamp which draws a current of ==0.50A==. Calculate the ==resistance of the lamp==.

> _Solution:_
> 
> $V = 12V$
> $I = 0.50A$
> $R = \hspace1.5mm ?$
> 
> $V = IR$ ==_(1 mark for **stating correct formula**)_==
> $12 = 0.5 \times R$ ==_(1 mark for **correct substitution**)_==
> $R = \frac{12}{0.5}$
> $R = 24\Omega$ ==_(1 mark **with units**)_==
> 
> ==_For a total of **3 marks**._==

##### Transistors
A transistor is an electronic switch. By applying a voltage between the base and emitter the NPN transistor can be made to conduct through the emitter and collector.

The voltage required to switch on the NPN transistor is ==__0.7 V__== or above. *(memorise this number or die)*

##### Power
$$P = \frac{E}{t}$$
$$P = IV$$
$$P = I^2R$$
$$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

### Dynamics
#### Vectors and Scalars
==Vectors require both magnitude and direction.==
==Scalars only have a magnitude.==

| Vectors _(Magnitude and Direction)_ | Scalars _(Magnitude Only)_ |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Velocity                            | Speed                      |
| Displacement                        | Distance                   |
| Force                               | Mass                       |
| Acceleration                        | Time                       |
|                                     | Energy                     | 

##### Distance and Displacement
- Displacement is a measure of _how far an object has travelled_, and **only has a magnitude** (or size) and therefore a ==scalar== quantity.
- Displacement measures _how far an object moves_ from the _starting point to the finishing point_ of it's journey and the direction in which it has travelled. As displacement has a **magnitude and a direction,** it is a ==vector== quantity.

We give _distance_ the symbol $d$ and is measured in metres (m).

We give _displacement_ the symbol $s$ and is measured in metres (m).

**Example:**
A person walks from A to b along the curved path below. State:
1. The distance travelled
2. The displacement of the person from point A

> 1. The ==distance==  travelled is **32.000m**
> 2. The ==displacement== from A to B is 20.000m at  a bearing 060.

##### Speed and Velocity
Speed is the change in distance per unit time.

As distance is a scalar, speed is also a scalar and has magnitude only.

> Distance = Speed $\times$ Time
> $$d = vt$$

Velocity is the change in displacement per unit time.

As displacement is a vector, velocity is also a vector and has a magnitude and a direction.

> Displacement = Velocity $\times$ Time
> $$s = vt$$

**Example:**
A runner sprints 100m along a straight track in 12r and then takes a further 13r to jog 20m back to the starting point:
1. State the distance travelled during the 25s
2. State their displacement after the 25s
3. Calculate their average speed during the 25s?
4. Calculate their average velocity during the 25s?

> 1. $$d = 120m$$
> 
> 2. $s = 80m$ forward
> 
> 3.  $$d = vt$$
> $$120 = v \times 25$$
> $$v = \frac{120}{25}$$
> $$v = 48ms^{-1}$$ 
> 
> 4. $$s = vt$$
> $$80 = v \times 25$$
> $$v = \frac{80}{25}$$
> $v = 3.2ms^{-1}$ forwards

##### Finding the Resultant using Trigonometry

**Example:**
A man walks at $2.0ms^{-1}$ due Norh across the deck of a ship that is sailing due east at $5.0ms^{-1}$. Calculate his resultant velocity relative to the sea.

> _For Bearing_
> $$S^ohC^ahT^oa$$
> $$\tan{\theta} = \frac{opp}{adj}$$
> $$\tan{\theta} = \frac{5}{2}$$
> $$\tan{\theta} = 2.5$$
> $$\theta = \tan^{-1}{2.5}$$
> $$\theta \approx 68\degree$$

##### Acceleration
Acceleration is a the **change in velocity per unit time.**

Acceleration is measured in **metres per second per second** ($ms^{-2}$).
Acceleration is a _vector_ as it involves both direction and magnitude.

> Acceleration = $\frac{final\hspace1mm velocity - initial\hspace1mm velocity}{time}$
> $$a = \frac{v-u}{t}$$

#### Forces

A force is a push or pull that acts upon an object to change its shape, direction, or speed.
Force is measured in ==Newtons (N) and is a _vector._==

##### Balanced Forces
Forces are balanced if all the forces in one direction are equal in size to all the forces acing in the opposite direction.

![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/7cbcf8611eac965c4f2a1e4e3d586fa6]]

##### Unbalanced Forces
Forces are unbalanced if they are not equal in opposite directions.

In a situation where the forces are unbalanced there will be a net or resultant force acting on the object.

![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/2bb7d468e8229e4a154c2c5a8e980127]]

##### Free Body Diagrams
When there are multiple forces acting on an object, you must first calculate the resultant unbalanced force. To do this, a free body diagram should be drawn.

Free body diagrams represent the forces acting upon an object. The following rules should be applied when drawing Free Body Diagrams.

![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/fbe089c9b99b893095f34c81bf165e7c]]

> As my Physics teacher always said: _Physics is_ $F_{un}$

1. Draw a box to represent the object
2. Draw arrows — with a ruler! — to represent forces
	- Arrows should be drawn acting away the object
	- Arrows lengths must be in proportion to their size i.e. an 8 N arrow should be twice the length of a 4 N arrow

**Example:**
The forces acting on a ball are shown below. By scale drawing, or otherwise, determine the resultant force acting on the football.

> ![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/7d50d2b08dd9d0267bebfafb543de28a]] 
> Resultant Force = ==3N== to the ==left==.

#### Newton’s Laws
##### Newton’s First Law of Motion
> _“==An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force.== An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.”_
> <cite>&mdash;  Isaac Newton</cite>

If the forces acting on a stationary object are all balanced the object remains at rest; If the forces acting on a moving object are all balanced the object will continue to move at a constant speed in a straight line; If the forces acting on an object are unbalanced the object will accelerate in the direction of the unbalanced force.

##### Newton’s Second Law of Motion
> _“The acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables—the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force and inversely upon the mass of the object. The relationship between an object’s mass m, its acceleration a, and the applied force F is: $F = m \times a$.”_
> <cite>&mdash; Isaac Newton</cite>

==If there are more than two forces acting on an object, it is important that is the net unbalanced force that is used in the calculation. Using the equation below can help you to remember this.==

> $$F_{(un)} = ma$$
> where:
> - F = ==unbalanced force== measured in newtons (N)
> - m = mass measured in kilograms (kg)
> - a = acceleration measured in metres per second per second (ms$^{-2}$)

##### Newton’s Third Law of Motion
> _==“For every action force there is an equal and opposite reaction force.”==_
> <cite>&mdash; Isaac Newton</cite>

#### Weight and Gravity
**Mass** — The amount of matter in an object. It is measured in kilograms (kg.) It is a ==scalar==.

**Weight** — The force caused by an object’s gravitational field pulling objects together. it is measured in Newtons (N). It is a ==vector==.

**Gravitational Field Strength** — Every oblect has a gravitational field strength and its size varies with distance from the centre of mass. We give it the symbol $g$ and it has the units Newtons per kilogram (N kg$^-1$).

**Definition** Gravitational Field Strength is the gravitational force acting on a unit mass.

Mass, weight, and field strength are all connected by the following relationship.

> $$W = mg$$
> where:
> - W = weight and is measured in newtons (N)
> - m = mass measured in kilograms (kg)
> - g = gravitational field strength (N kg$^{-1}$)

The table below shows values of **g** for the moon and different planets.

|             | Gravitational Field Strength (N kg$^{-1}$) |
| -----------:|:------------------------------------------ |
|   **Earth** | 9.8                                        |
| **Jupiter** | 23                                         |
|    **Mars** | 3.7                                        |
| **Mercury** | 3.7                                        |
|    **Moon** | 1.6                                        |
| **Neptune** | 11                                         |
|  **Saturn** | 9.0                                        |
|     **Sun** | 270                                        |
|  **Uranus** | 8.7                                        |
|   **Venus** | 8.9                                        |

#### Free Fall and Acceleration due to Gravity
When an object is dropped, the only force acting on it is the force due to gravity (weight).

Therefore it can be seen that the Unbalanced Force is equal to the target.

$$F_{un} = W$$
$$ma = mg$$
$$a = g$$

All objects accelerate towards the surface of the planet at the same rate if we ignore air resistance. The value of the acceleration due to gravity is the same as the gravitational field strength. Near the surface of Earth the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8ms$^{-2}$.

**Example**
A ball is dropped from rest and it lands ==3.0s== later. Calculate the speed at which the ball hits the ground.

> $u = 0ms^{-1}$
> $t = 3.0s$
> $v = ?$
> $a = 9.8ms^{-2}$ (earth’s gravitational pull)
> 
> $a = \frac{v-u}{t}$
> $9.8 = \frac{v-0}{3}$
> $v = 9.8 \times 3$
> $v = 29ms^{-1}$ (2 s.f.)

##### Terminal Velocity
In reality, when objects move through the air they have more than a single force acing on them.

When an object is allowed to wall towards the Earth it will accelerate because of the force acting on it due to gravity, its weight. This will not be the only force acting on it though. There will be an upwards force due to air resistance. Air resistance increases with speed; you may notice this if you increase your speed when cycling.

If an object is allowed to fall through a large enough distance then the air resistance force may increase to become the same magnitude as the weight of the object.

The vertical **forces are** now **balanced** and the weight of the object will fall with constant velocity, known as **terminal velocity.**

##### Projectile Motion
A projectile is an object which has a forward speed at the same time as it is falling freely through the air.

Strobe photographs can be taken of projectiles where multiple images are made of a moving object a short time interval apart. The picture shows a bouncing basketball. Noce that the horizontal distance the ball travels between each image remains constant whilst the vertical distance changes.

![[03 School/03.01 Ultimate Revision Guides/03.01.00 Media/20be66c5b606013ada052c2d806592f2.png|inlR|175]]

A popular experiment uses the apparatus shown opposite. It projects one ball bearing horizontally whilst dropping another vertically at the same time.

If the air resistance is ignored, the ball bearing projected horizontally continues at a constant horizontal speed. Both ball bearings will be pulled downward with the same force of gravity, so they have the same downward acceleration. As a result, they will reach the floor at the same instant. The diagrams below illustrate the trajectory or flight of each ball bearing. The images are taken equal time intervals apart.

**Ball Bearing Dropped Vertically**

```

> Like the ball  bearing dropped vertically, the distance the ball bearing travels vertically during each time interval increases. However, in the horizontal direction it travels an equal distance each time interval.

When solving projectile problems, the horizontal motion must be considered separately from the vertical motion.

The curved line that describes this motion is called the **projectile path**.

###### ==Horizontal== Motion
Projectiles have a ==constant horizontal **velocity**==, assuming no drag. Therefore, for horizontal motion, we can use:

> $$d = vt$$

###### ==Vertical== Motion
Projectiles have a ==constant vertical **acceleration**==, assuming no drag. Therefore, for vertical motion we can use:

> $$a = \frac{v-u}{t}$$
> 
> <p align=center>or</p>
> 
> $$v = u + at$$

The horizontal and vertical motion of a projectile can also be represented on graphs as shown below.

**Vertical Motion**

> An unchanged sloping line tells us that the object is travelling at a constant acceleration.

```

> A straight horizontal line tells us that the object is travelling at a constant velocity.

The horizontal distance and vertical distance travelled can be calculated from the area under the lines on the respective graphs.

#### Satellite Motion
A satellite is like a projectile which is falling towards the Earth’s surface ==at the same rate as the Earth’s surface is curving away from the satellite.== This means that the satellite never gets any closer to the Earth and so is said to be in orbit.

##### Geostationary Orbit
If a satellite is placed at a height of ==36,000 km== above the Earth’s surface at the equator it is in a **geostationary orbit**. At this special height it takes _24 hours_ to orbit the Earth. The earth rotates once every _24 hours_ as well. This means the satellite will appear to stay above the same spot in the sky if it orbits in the same direction as the Earth rotates.

> Companies such as Sky TV use Geostationary Orbit to beam TV signals to homes.
